❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` is missing parameter definitions. Without knowing what `a` and `b` are, the function will likely
result in unexpected behavior or errors (e.g., `NaN` if `a` and `b` are undefined).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are the values to be added together.
* ✔ This makes the function reusable and predictable.

Final Note: Always define parameters for your functions to ensure they operate correctly and avoid unintended side
effects. This also increases the readability and maintainability of your code.
